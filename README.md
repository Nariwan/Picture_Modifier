# What is required?
It's based on Java and JavaFX, so a JavaFX installation is required.
<br/>There's a module-info.java included which should help to run it.

<br/>OpenCV is also needed.

# What does it do?
With this short application, someone is able to convert picture into binary ( B/W ) pictures.
<br/>It's easy to pick the threshold at which the conversion should take place, and it's also
possible to name the outcome file.

# Where is the outcome file?
It's in the folder of the project. 
<br/>For Linux : "/home/'UserName'/"Project Folder"/Picture_Modifier"
<br/>For Windows : "\\"Path to project Folder"\Picture_Modifier"
<br/>("C:\User\\'UserName'\Ideaprojects\Picture_Modifier") <- as example
<br/>For mac :
<br/>Don't own one, so don't know.

# Used IDE
  Don't know if this is needed, yet it has been written in IntelliJ.
  
# Any future plans?
  Adding chromatic aberration would be neat.
