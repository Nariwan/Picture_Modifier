# What is required?
It's based on Java and JavaFX, so a JavaFX installation is required.
There's a module-info.java included which should help to run it.

OpenCV is also needed.

# What does it do?
With this short application, someone is able to convert picture into binary ( B/W ) pictures.
It's easy to pick the threshold at which the conversion should take place, and it's also
possible to name the outcome file.

# Where is the outcome file?
It's in the folder of the project.
For Linux i.e :
"/home/<username>/IdeaProjects/Picture_Modifier"

# Used IDE
  Don't know if this is needed, yet it has been written in IntelliJ.

# Any future plans?
  Adding chromatic aberration would be neat.
  Also threshold field input check.
